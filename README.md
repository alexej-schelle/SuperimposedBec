# superimposed-quantum-fields

The routine superimposed-bec.py is a Markov sampling method, more specific, a (generalised) Metropolis sampling algorithm for calculating the integrated (random) superimposed condensate and non-condensate wave fields (order parameters) for a given total particle number, temperature and trap frequency of a Bose-Einstein condensate, as it would correspond to a measurement of the two orthogonal quantum fields (condensate and non-condensate).

For proper installation, please replace the path /your-installation-path/ with your installation path in the lines ... of this code.

The Python routine superimposed-quantum-fields.py is compatible with Python 2 or Python 3 (for Version 3, some parts have to be changed) 
and calculates :

- Superimposed field modes

In order to start superimposed-quantum-fields.py, please specify BEC parameters :

maxmode # typical mode size for analysis : 50 - 500 modes # <br>
ptn # typical particle number : 10^3 - 10^5 # <br>
sample # Typical sample size : 10^5 - 10^8 # <br>

omx # trap frequency in x direction # <br>
omy # trap frequency in y direction # <br>
omz # trap frequency in z direction # <br>

start_temp # in units of nK # <br>

in the source code as required and run the simulation in the command line with the command

python superimposed-quantum-fields.py

using Python Version 2 or Version 3 (for Version 3, some parts in the code must be changed).
